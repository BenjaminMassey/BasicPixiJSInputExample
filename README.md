# Basic PixiJS Input Example

Made by Ben Massey, Feb 2018

## What is it?

Simple interface using PixiJS that supports desktop
through physical keypresses and mobile through a virtual
key panel.

## How to use

Just a simple http server - a basic Mongoose exe is included
for windows. Then go to wherever you're hosting it, and it
should work! Keys that you can use are arrow keys, X and Y.
